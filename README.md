## Implementation
PreLoadMe is jQuery driven. You will need to implement an up to date jQuery version and the corresponding JavaScript for executing the preloader.

    <!-- jQuery Plugin -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.3.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Preloader -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        //<![CDATA[
            $(window).on('load', function() { // makes sure the whole site is loaded
                $('#status').fadeOut(); // will first fade out the loading animation
                $('#preloader').delay(350).fadeOut('slow'); // will fade out the white DIV that covers the website.
                $('body').delay(350).css({'overflow':'visible'});
              })
        //]]>
    </script>

The CSS-Markup will help you style the preloader. Make sure to include it on your website.

```
  #preloader {
      display: block;
      position: fixed;
      top:0;
      left:0;
      right:0;
      bottom:0;
  		background: #C9D6FF;  /* fallback for old browsers */
  		background: -webkit-linear-gradient(to bottom, #E2E2E2, #C9D6FF);  /* Chrome 10-25, Safari 5.1-6 */
  		background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #E2E2E2, #C9D6FF); /* W3C, IE 10+/ Edge, Firefox 16+, Chrome 26+, Opera 12+, Safari 7+ */
  		z-index:99; /* makes sure it stays on top */
  }

  #status {
      display: block;
      width:40px;
      height:40px;
      position:absolute;
      left:50%; /* centers the loading animation horizontally on the screen */
      top:50%; /* centers the loading animation vertically on the screen */
      border-radius: 50%;
      border: 0.25rem solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
      border-top-color: white;
      -webkit-animation: spin 1s infinite linear;
      animation: spin 1s infinite linear;
      margin:-20px 0 0 -20px; /* is width and height divided by two */
  }
```

Finally place the following HTML Code directly after the `<body>` tag.

	<div id="preloader">
		<div id="status">&nbsp;</div>
	</div>

The outer DIV `preloader` will be called from the CSS file and will cover the entire website with a white DIV. The inner DIV `status` will show the loading animation. Also you should not forget to give your document a proper doctype. Otherwise the preloader might not work.
